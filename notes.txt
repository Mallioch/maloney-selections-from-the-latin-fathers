TERTULLIAN (160-about 230 a.d.)

Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus was bom at
Carthage, — a city then and afterward of the greatest im-
portance as a centre of Latin Christianity. His father was
a centurion in the Roman army. Tertullian studied law,
and afterward taught rhetoric in Carthage, until about the
year 192, when he became a Christian. From that time
to the end of his life he devoted himself unwaveringly to
the promulgation of the doctrines of his religion.

His life was one of tireless effort and the most rigid
asceticism. He crushed remorselessly all his desires and
affections, however high and noble, except those purely
spiritual. Even his love for his wife, to whom two of his
finest treatises are addressed, he sternly repressed, leaving
her that he might lead a life of greater devotion. Until
the year 201, he preached and wrote incessantly in defence
of Christianity. Then he joined the Montanists, — a sect
that claimed to have reached to the highest spiritual gifts
through the severest austerity of life. With them he re-
mained but a short time ; and when he left them, he took
with him a small number of followers, whom he instructed,
and upon whom he enforced his most extreme principles of
bodily mortification. Beyond the statement of St. Jerome
that he lived to " a decrepit age," we have little or nothing to
fix the time of his death.

On account of his early zeal, Tertullian is considered, in
31

spite of his heresy, the first Father of the Latin Church.
His attitude was always militant and aggressive, and his
war was unceasing on everything that made against religion,
whether it was human desires and passions in the hearts of
his followers, or the opposition of unbelievers. He taunted
the pagans, in stinging, scornful words, for their customs,
philosophy, and religion. Against anything savoring of
compromise, Tertullian thundered as loudly as against pa-
ganism itself. Origen, the first of the Christian Greek
writers, sought to reach the pagans through points of con-
tact between their belief and his; to Tertullian the two
beliefs were utterly antagonistic, and he refused to come to
close quarters with his enemy at any point, but stood afar
off and hurled his bolts, each one with all the force he could
command. As Pressens^ points out, the contrast extends
also to the styles of the two writers. "The eloquence of
the one " (Origen), he says, " is as large and limpid as his
genius; it is as a beautiful river, abundant and majestic;
that of the other is a mountain torrent. Origen lightens,
Tertullian thunders. Origen speaks to Christian philoso-
phers like a Christian philosopher ; Tertullian is a tribune
of the people, who has gone down to the forum and the
cross-roads to kindle the minds of the crowd."

The selection given is Chapters V-VII from the De
Spectaculis. The treatise was called forth, probably, by
the public shows given by the Emperor Severus in honor
of his victory over Albinus. Tertullian's argument is that
shows are idolatrous in origin and character.

ST. CYPRIAN (200-268 a.d.)

Thascius Cecilius Cyprianus was bom at Carthage. His
parents were wealthy and distinguished, and Cyprian re-
ceived a thorough education in philosophy. For many
years, until the time of his conversion to Christianity, he
taught rhetoric. He was baptized in the year 246, and two
years later he was ordained a priest. In his preaching and
ministrations, his charity and humility so won the hearts
of his hearers that, in spite of his remonstrances, he was
elected Bishop of Carthage.

During the persecution of the Christians by the Emperor
Decius, in the year 249, the life of Cyprian, as the leader of
the Church in Africa, was particularly sought. He fled
from Carthage, returning the following year, when the rigor
of the persecution had abated. When the plague swept
over the city in 252, Cyprian was constantly active in his
ministrations to the sick and dying. He was aided in this
work by rich and poor. Christians and pagans, whom he
organized into a society for nursing the sick and burying
the dead.



Pagb6] St. Cyprian 35

Some five years later, under the persecution by Valerian,
Cyprian was banished from Carthage. In less than a year,
however, he was brought back, tried before the proconsul,
sentenced to death, and beheaded.

In his method and lines of thought he followed closely in
the footsteps of TertuUian, whom he called his master. His
style, however, is very different from TertuUian's. Sarcasm,
invective, or abuse he never used, but established his points
firmly by means of logic and clear reasoning. His argu-
ments gained power from the example he set in his own life,
which was always of the utmost simplicity and purity.

The purpose of the tract On the Vanity of Idols, from
which this selection is made, is to show that the gods were no
more than deified men. His argument is essentially the same
as that of Euhemeros, Tertulliau, and Clement of Alexandria.
This tract is, as Farrar says, " St. Cyprian's farewell to hea-
thendom as a religious system." The work is a careful
analysis of mythologic beliefs, by one who was a witness of
their practice, and, to a certain extent, of their decay.

LACTANTIUS (about 260-^30 a.d.)

Lactantius was born near the middle of the third century,
probably, at Firmum, in Italy. Very little is known of his
life. He embraced Christianity from conviction, and de-
voted his life and talents to its defence. Such was his repu-
tation for learning that Constantiue appointed him, in the
year 313, preceptor to the prince, Crespus. Jerome refers to
him as " the most learned man of his time." The clearness,
force, and beauty of Lactantius' style, the classic quality of
his Latin, and his skill in argument, have frequently led
men to compare him with Cicero.

The selection given here is from the Book on the Death
of Persecutors, It deals with the persecution under Diocle-
tian, of which Lactantius was a witness.

ST. JEROME (331-ABOUT 422 a.d.)

St. Jerome (St. Hieronymus) was born at Stridon, a little
town on the borders of Dalmatia. The wealth of his father,
Eusebius, placed the best educational resources of the time
at his disposal. In Rome he studied the classics under
Donatus, and it is commonly believed that he afterward
studied law. It was while studying in Rome that Jerome
fell a prey, as he tells us, to the temptations of which the
city was so full at the time. Finally, however, he rose above
them, and in 360 he was baptized. His baptism was fol-
lowed by a period of travel, during which he visited
Aquilea, Treves, Antioch, and Syria. On his return he was
long occupied in the study of the Scriptures and the revision
of the Latin Gospels, — a task intrusted to him by Pope
Damasus. In 385, after a pilgrimage through the Holy
Land, Jerome settled at Bethlehem, where a monastery
was built for him. Here he translated the Old Testament
from Greek into Latin. This translation occupied him up
to 405, some fifteen years in all, and was his last important
work. It was while he was engaged on this work that his
friendship of twenty-five years' standing with Rufinus was
broken by religious controversy. He died and was buried
at Bethlehem, but his body was afterward removed to
Rome.

Jerome was a deeply learned man, and some of his works
on subjects outside his chosen field, notably geography and
history, were of real importance in advancing the learning
of his time. In life he practised the austerity which he so
earnestly preached ; his discourses were always most eloquent
in rebuking luxury, effeminacy, vanity, and avarice. Farrar
says that Jerome stands far higher than Lactantius, in

be so purely classical.

ST. AMBROSE (about 330-397 a.d.)

Ambrose was bom at Treves, and received a Christian
education, studying and afterward practising law. He be-
came prefect of Liguria and Aemilia while living at Milan,
and in 374 was elected Bishop of Milan. The^qualities which
had gained him this position, — his courage, diplomacy, and
unwavering sense of duty, — made him, in filling it, " a tower
of impregnable strength " to the Church. He was the adviser
of Yalentinian I. and II. and of Theodosius, and his fearless
and inexhaustible energy in upholding the dignity of the
Church against intrigue and despotism ceased only with his
life. The chief merits of his style are its clearness and di-
rectness. It has little in the way of grace and harmony, but
is always terse and practical. The selection given in the
text is from a reply to a petition of Symmachus to the
emperor, to restore an altar and golden statue of victory,
and to reestablish the ancient orders of priests and virgins
who attended it. In this letter, Ambrose threatens Valen-

ST. AUGUSTINE (364-430 a.d.)

St. Augustine was born at Tagasta, in Africa. At the age
of seventeen he was sent to Carthage to complete his educa-
tion. Here he became a convert to the Manichean doctrines,
greatly to the sorrow of his mother, who was a Christian.
After gaining a reputation for eloquence and learning, he
went to Rome, and then to Milan. His mother followed
him from place to place, seeking his conversion, which was
finally brought about by St. Ambrose. On the death of his
mother, a year after his baptism, Augustine returned to
Tagasta. After dividing his property among the poor, he
retired for three years of solitary meditation and study. In
later life he was elected Bishop of Hippo. He perished at



Page 30] St. Augustine 43

the age of 76, in the siege of Hippo, refusing to leave his
post "when the Yandals surrounded the city.

In many of his writings, as in this selection from his
Confessions, St. Augustine shows his early classical train-
ing, to which he owed a debt he often acknowledged. In
this case, however, he shows no sympathy for the literature
and philosophy in which he was trained.
