PREFACE

The selections given here have been chosen carefully as characteristic specimens of the styles of the different periods they represent, in order to afford a basis for comparison, not only between the different periods of the early church, but between the Christian writers and those of classic times. The Introduction attempts to trace the origin and growth of Christian Latin, and the brief biographies in the Notes aim to give the student some idea of the life and influence of the writer he is studying.

The book has been prepared in response to an urgent demand for a volume of representative selections from the Latin Fathers. It is to be hoped that those with whom the demand arose will find these selections not only representative, but efficient in promoting, by contrast with the teachings of classic mythology, the very highest ideals of conduct and of life.

INTRODUCTION

The language in which these selections from the Latin Fathers is written is that of the post-classical period of Latin literature, and varies to a marked degree from that used by the classical writers. This post-classical, or Christian, Latin had its origin in the adoption by the Church of Latin as its official language, and grew out of the classic or pagan Latin, not by destroying and supplanting, but by reviving and purifying it.

Thus the early Fathers did not — as they might so easily have done — destroy the entire body of a literature, which was to them a mass of impurity and error. This would have been to kill a language in which they saw broad possibilities for usefulness and good. In speaking of the Christian use of the Latin language, Ozanam says: —

"With the adoption of the language by the Church came the beginning of the changes which were finally to alter it so much. From a high degree of artificiality, the Fathers turned back to the utmost directness and simplicity. Their effects they gained not through studied eloquence, but through the earnestness, strength, and simplicity of their language. With the change in style came inevitable changes in the language itself. New ideas and new methods of thought caused changes in the meanings of established words, and the coining of words entirely new."

These changes were perhaps most marked at the beginning of the period, for the men who first wrote and preached in Latin were nearly all trained in pagan schools of rhetoric. They, in changing their language to correspond with the complete change in their ways of thought, swung at once far to the other extreme. The Christian Apologists — Minucius Felix, Tertullian, Cyprian, and Lactantius — were all trained in pagan schools, and soon learned to bombard heathen enemies with their own artillery. Their contemporaries and successors sprang up rapidly, from Spain, Gaul, Africa, and Italy; Hilary, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine were soon actively engaged in defending the new religion. The Middle Ages brought St. Bernard, Albertus Magnus, St. Thomas Aquinas, and other dialecticians, theologians, and controversialists, who firmly established Latin as "the learned tongue."

Were there no other reason, then, these writers, who changed the character of a great language and made an epoch in its literature, should have a place in modern school and college curriculums. These changes in language and literature, too, are the reflections of the more important changes that were taking place as these men wrote, changes in human thought, belief, and history. In reading these selections the student cannot but gather some knowledge of the spirit that inspired the men who wrote them, and be moved to emulation of worthier heroes than those of Ovid or Virgil.
